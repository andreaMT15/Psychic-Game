# Psychic-Game

**Developer: Andrea Minhas**

**Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, Vanilla Javascript

A front end application that was developed as a psychic game in which the computer generates a random letter for the user to guess. The user is given 9 attempts to type in the letter that the computer generated. As the user is typing in the letters, they are being printed on the screen and the number of guesses left decreases. If the user guesses the random letter within the first 9 attempts the wins will increase by 1 and the game will reset. If not, the losses will increase by 1 and the game will reset.
